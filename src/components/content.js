    <p>
      I am a Developer from Toronto, currently working on the wonderful team at{' '}
      <a href="https://looka.com">Looka</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Development has not always been my thing, however. For over nine years I
      was a designer, covering a wide range of fields including advertising,
      publishing, and corporate branding. Although the majority of my early work
      was print based, I really wanted to get into more digital projects. So I
      started learning to code to gain a deeper understanding, and quickly fell
      in love with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending some time as a Designer/Developer hybrid on the marketing
      team at <a href="https://tophat.com">Top Hat</a>, I found Looka (or they
      found me I should say) and I have settled into a full time development
      role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the languages I work in regularly are HTML, CSS, JS, React/Redux,
      Node, Wordpress/PHP. I love love love CSS and focusing on the visual
      details on any project, which should come as no surprise given my
      background. That said, I love learning new things and enjoy the process of
      getting better, I beleive anyone can learn anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding you can find me ripping around the city on my bike,
      probably going to eat pizza somewhere or hanging out in a park with my
      dog, Wella.
